# eyes

## Description
This project contains two eyes that will follow the movement of the users cursor.

## How To Run
You can run this project directly from my profile page by navigating to dylanavernon.github.io and finding the project on my projects page.

## Future Improvements
A later version of this project will include a mechanism for disabling the tracking motion of the eyes and a mechanism to allow the user to add more eyes.
